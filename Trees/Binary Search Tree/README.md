### 01. Binary Search Trees: Insertion

    Binary Search Trees: Insertion
    It will insert the Node to the Binary Search Tree

    Example:

                  4
                /    \
               2       8
                \       \
                  5       10

    insert a Node with data 1
    it will start from root node 
    is the data less than root node.
    
    1 < 4

    yes

    move left

    is the data less than cur node.

    1 < 2

    yes

    move left

    if no node in the left 

    simply, insert the node over there
