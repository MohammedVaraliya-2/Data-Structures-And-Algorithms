# Data-Structures And Algorithms


## 01. Greedy Algorithms: Optimal Task Assignment

    Assign tasks to workers such that the time it takes to complete all tasks is minimized.
    here, the elements in an array is duration of time

## 02. Sorting Algorithms: Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays

    Given two arrays, A and B, determine their intersection. That is, what elements are common to A and B?


## 03. Binary Search: Find Closest Number

    given a sorted array and a target number. we need to find a number in the array that is closest to the target number.

    The array may contain duplicate values and negative numbers.

    Example 1:
        Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9}
        Target number = 11
        Output : 9
        9 is closest to 11 in given array

    Example 2:
        Input :arr[] = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9};
        Target number = 4
        Output : 5
