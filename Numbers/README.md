### 01. Product of Two Numbers

    Product of Two Numbers
    Given two numbers, find their product using recursion.

    Example:
            x = 5
            y = 4

    x * y = 20

    using recursion:
    addition of x with y times
    It means:
            x = 5
            y = 4

    5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20
