### 01. Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

```bash
Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse
It will reversed the Singly Linked List

Example:
        "A"
        "B"
        "C"
        "D"
        "E"

reversed_list :
                "E"
                "D"
                "C"
                "B"
                "A"

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

### 02. Singly Linked Lists -- Merge Two Sorted Lists

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

```bash
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### 03. Singly Linked Lists -- Reorder List

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

```bash
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

### 04. Singly Linked Lists -- Remove Nth Node From End of List

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

```bash
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
