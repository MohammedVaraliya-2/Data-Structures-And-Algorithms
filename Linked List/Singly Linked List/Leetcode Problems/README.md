### 01. Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

```bash
Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse
It will reversed the Singly Linked List

Example:
        "A"
        "B"
        "C"
        "D"
        "E"

reversed_list :
                "E"
                "D"
                "C"
                "B"
                "A"

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

### 02. Singly Linked Lists -- Merge Two Sorted Lists

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

```bash
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
