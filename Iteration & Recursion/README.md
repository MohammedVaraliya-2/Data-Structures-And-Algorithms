### 01. Understanding Iterative Approach

    Understanding Iterative Approach
    The repeated execution of some groups of code statements in a program is called iteration.

    Example:
    
    To find a sum of given n number
    we will iterate n + 1 number and add the number into sum variable. i.e

    find_sum(5)

    initialize sum = 0

    we will iterate to n + 1 number which is 5, and add a number into sum variable
    i = 0   i.e 0 + 0   = 0
    i = 1   i.e 0 + 1   = 1
    i = 2   i.e 1 + 2   = 3
    i = 3   i.e 3 + 3   = 6
    i = 4   i.e 6 + 4   = 10
    i = 5   i.e 10 + 5  = 15
