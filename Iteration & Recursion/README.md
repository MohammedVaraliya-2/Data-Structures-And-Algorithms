### 01. Understanding Iterative Approach

    Understanding Iterative Approach
    The repeated execution of some groups of code statements in a program is called iteration.

    Example:
    
    To find a sum of given n number
    we will iterate n + 1 number and add the number into sum variable. i.e

    find_sum(5)

    initialize sum = 0

    we will iterate to n + 1 number which is 5, and add a number into sum variable
    i = 0   i.e 0 + 0   = 0
    i = 1   i.e 0 + 1   = 1
    i = 2   i.e 1 + 2   = 3
    i = 3   i.e 3 + 3   = 6
    i = 4   i.e 6 + 4   = 10
    i = 5   i.e 10 + 5  = 15

### 02. Understanding Recursive Approach

    Understanding Recursion Approach
    Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. 
    Recursive algorithms are widely used in computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler ones.

    Given a number n, find sum of first n natural numbers. To calculate the sum, we will use a recursive function find_sum().

    Examples : 

    To find a sum of given n number

    Example 1: Let n = 5

               Therefore, the sum of the first 5 natural numbers = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

               Thus, the output is 15.

    Example 2: Let n = 7

               Therefore, the sum of the first 7 natural numbers = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
   
               Thus, the output is 28.

    Example 3: Let n = 6

               Therefore, the sum of the first 6 natural numbers = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.
           
               Thus, the output is 21.
