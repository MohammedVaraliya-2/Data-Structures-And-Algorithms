# Data-Structures And Algorithms


### 01. Binary search

    Binary search
    Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.

    In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.

    Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items. If the elements are not sorted already, 
    we need to sort them first.

    Example:
    Let us take the following sorted array and we need to search element 6.

                    [2,	5,	6,	8,	10,	11,	13,	15,	16]

                Low=0   <-- index number
                High=8  <-- index number
                Mid=4   <-- index number 

                    [2,	5,	6,	8,	10,	11,	13,	15,	16]

                6 < 10, therefore take the first half.

                High=Mid-1

                Low=0
                High=3 
                Mid=1

                    [2,	5,	6,	8,	10,	11,	13,	15,	16]

                6==6, an element found

                Hence the element 6 is found at index 2.
