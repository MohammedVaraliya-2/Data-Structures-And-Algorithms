# Data-Structures And Algorithms

### 01. Queue Data Structure

    Queue Data Structure.
    Queue is FIFO(First In First Out) or LILO(Last In Last Out) data structure.

    Example:
            queue = []

    Now, insert an element 1 at index 0

            queue = [1]

    Now, insert some more elements at index 0
    So, every element which was placed on index 0 will push by 1 when you try to insert at index 0
    queue will look like

            queue = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

    if i use pop() to queue
    it will return the last element in the list which is 1
    hence FIFO proved

### 02. Queue Data Structure : Using dequeue

    Queue Data Structure : Using dequeue
    deque is using Doubly Linked List data structure to store the element.

### 03. Queue Data Structure : Producer Consumer Problem

    Queue Data Structure : Producer Consumer Problem
    This problem is a producer,consumer problem where producer thread is producing data whereas consumer 
    thread is consuming the data which has already produced.
